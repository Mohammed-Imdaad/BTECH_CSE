## Btech_CSE-Materials by Imdaad

### Overview
Welcome to the **Btech_CSE-Materials** repository! This project was created out of a personal need to centralize and simplify access to study materials during my Btech days. My friends and I often struggled to find and keep track of essential materials, and I wanted to create a solution for others facing the same challenges.

### Purpose
This repository serves as a one-stop resource for Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students. Whether you're a current student, someone looking for reference materials, or a future student seeking organized resources, this repository is designed to help.

### What Youâ€™ll Find
- **Semester Materials**: Comprehensive resources for Btech 3_1, 3_2, 4_1, 4_2, and other semesters.
- **All-in-One Access**: Includes lecture notes, assignments, and other useful study aids.
